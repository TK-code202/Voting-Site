            <h4 class="text-center">Basic Election Information</h4> 
            <p>Presidential and National Assembly Election - 25th February, 2023</p> 
            <p>Governorship and State Houses of Assembly Election - 11th March,
            2023</p> 
            <p>Time - 8:30am to 2:30pm</p> 
            <p>(However, voters on the queue on or before 2:30pm will be allowed
            to vote)</p>
            <h4>Who is allowed (eligible) to vote?</h4> 
            <p>To vote, you must be:</p> 
            <ul>
               <li>A Nigerian, 18 years and above</li> 
                <li>A registered voter</li>  
                <li>In possession of a Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC)</li> 
                <li>Appear in person at the polling unit</li> 
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Where Can I Vote?</h4> 
            <p>You will vote in the polling unit where your name is enlisted in the
            Register of Voters.</p> 
            <h4>Do I need my PVC to be able to Vote?</h4> 
            <p>YES! Only those with their PVC and that are authenticated using the
            BVAS device (fingerprint or facial recognition) shall be allowed to vote.
            NO PVC, NO VOTING!</p> 
            <h4>What is BVAS?</h4>
            <p>BVAS is an electronic machine called Bimodal Voter Accreditation
            System. It is used for voter verification and authentication to confirm
            the identity of a voter using either their fingerprints or face.</p> 
            <h4>Significance of BVAS</h4> 
            <p>The BVAS and/or any other electronic device INEC uses at elections has
            been backed by the Electoral Act 2022. It ensures that only persons
            eligible to vote and in possession of their PVCs and whose names are
            on the register of voters of a particular polling unit are allowed to vote
            at that polling unit and to only vote once.</p> 
            <p>Differences between BVAS and the Smart Card Reader (SCR) previously
            used by INEC</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>It verifies and accredits voter using either their fingerprints or
                their face, eliminating failure to accredit eligible voter.</li>
                <li>Details of voters are stored on the BVAS and not on the PVC
                as was the case with SCR.</li>
                <li>BVAS is used as INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED) during
                voters registration.</li> 
                <li>BVAS is used for uploading election results to the INEC Results
                viewing Portal (IReV).</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Note:</h5>
            <p>The BVAS automatically updates itself as accreditation takes place
            hence, the figures cannot be manipulated.</p>
            <h4>PROCEDURE FOR ACCREDITATION AND VOTING</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Accreditation</li>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Polling Unit will open at 8:30am and close at 2:30pm or when
                    the last person on the queue on or before 2:30pm votes. This
                    means that all eligible voters on queue as at 2:30pm will be
                    allowed to vote.</li>
                    <li>Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) shall be used
                    to verify you (voter) as the valid owner of the PVC in your
                    possession and that your name is on the Register of Voters in
                    that polling unit.</li> 
                    <li>It will match your fingerprints and (or) face; one of which must
                    successfully identify you as the owner of the PVC presented to
                    the official before you will be allowed to vote.</li> 
                    <li>If the BVAS fails to recognise your fingerprint, the facial
                    recognition function of BVAS will be used to verify and accredit
                    you.</li>
                    <li>After the above steps are successfully completed, a poll official
                    will check for your name in the Register of Voters and tick it.</li>
                    <li>Indelible ink will be applied on the cuticle of your finger.</li> 
                    <li>A stamped, signed and dated ballot paper will be issued to
                    you.</li>
                    <li>If the BVAS fails to recognise your fingerprints as well as facial
                    photograph, you will not be allowed to vote.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Voting</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You will go to the voting cubicle to mark your choice on the
                        ballot paper in secret.</li>
                        <li>Ensure the ink does not smear other parts of the ballot paper
                        to avoid your vote being rejected.</li> 
                        <li>The ballot paper should be folded vertically.</li> 
                        <li>You are not allowed to take photograph of the ballot paper
                        when in the voting cubicle.</li>
                        <li>You will drop the marked ballot paper into the ballot box in
                        full view of all present.</li> 
                        <li>After casting your vote, you are free to remain 300 metres
                        from the polling area to witness sorting, counting and
                        announcement of result, provided you are orderly and do not
                        disrupt the process.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h4>Collation and Announcement of Results</h4>
            <p>Results shall be collated at various levels depending on the type of
            election, after which it is announced by INEC.</p> 
            <p>In order to enhance transparency, INEC has provided an online
            results viewing portal called IReV (www.inecelectionsresults.ng)
            where you can view results of all polling units in real time before they
            are declared at the end of the election by INEC.</p>
